Hi Folks,

this is grappelli a custom user interface for django's admin interface. it customizes django's admin by overwriting templates and media files only. And a middleware...but no python code of django.contib.admin is overwritten.

Here are some infos about the customizations:


JavaScript code:

#
# actions.js
#
Stripped out in middleware JavaScript404Patch. We do this in @see grappelli.change_list.js


#
# admin/DateTimeShortcuts.js
#
Used for time fields only. So the code to create js magic for date fields is commented out.
Datefields @see grappelli.js


#
# ordering.js
#
?


#
# RelatedObjectLookups.js
#
Used by @see grappelli.RelatedObjectLookups.js


#
# calendar.js
#
?


#
# collapse.js
#
?


#
# core.js
#
?


#
# dateparse.js
#
?


#
# getElementBySelector.js
#
?


#
# grappelli.change_list.js
#
all js magic for change_list.html. actions, edit inline, search, filter,...
has no dependencies (except jQuery).


#
# grappelli.js
#
initialize collapsebles, DatePicker (for date fields not time fields) and some 
"hacks" (stuff that should be customized in templates, but the html is generated in the python code):
 - Strip label like text from DateTimeFields.
 - more to come :(


...to be continued!
